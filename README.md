# Data-Structures
Sample code for different types of data structures written in C. Meant for *educational purposes*.

####Including:
* Stacks
* Queues
* Lists
	* Simple-linked
	* Double-linked
* Circular lists (same types as above)
* Binary trees
* Hash tables

## Usage
Include .h and .c files containing the data structure you want to use in your project.  
Each couple of files contains the basic functions for the specific data structure it defines.  
These functions are defined for a specific data type which you can change according to your needs by modifing the `typedef char datatype;` line of the .h file, just replace `char` for whatever datatype you want to use.
